RCraft: A Ruby Minecraft Server Wrapper
Verion 0.1.8

=====
About:
=====
rcraft is a Ruby wrapper for Minecraft
It requires a Ruby installation and Minecraft server file to run.
The choice in the name is two fold: R for Ruby and R for Our, as we make minecraft our own.

Testing Environment: Ubuntu 10.10 Server

Features:
- Welcome message (Via config.yml)
- !help command (basic implimentation)
- !request command for players to request items  and Kits
-- Listing comes from itemlist.yml
-- Uses server command: give <player> <id> <quantity>
-- Format: !request <quantity> <item>
-- Example: !request 10 Stone
-- Friendly item names: Use item names rather than ID's 
-- Support requests for more than 64 of an item 
-- MOD Friendly: Unrecognized items IDs will attempt to request the item by ID
- !item command to request listing of matching items
-- Format: !item name
-- Example: !item ore 
-- Result: Listing of all items with 'ore' in their names
- !players command for players to see the list of other logged in players (Future)
-- Uses server command: list
- Backup system that will shut down the server, back it up, and restart the server (Future)
- Command to change the server time. Convenient for when multiple people are logged in.
-- Will need something to restrict spamming time changes.
=====
Usage:
===== 
Place in the same directory as minecraft_server.jar.
Directory path, parameters, and differently named jar file will be configurable via config file in the future.
Run via: ruby rcraft.rb
