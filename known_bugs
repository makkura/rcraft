Known Bugs:

Item names with multiple capital letters in them (eg: TNT) do not appear
when using !request tnt or !item tnt  because it is treated as Tnt rather than TNT
- Proposed solution: upper case all input words and either upper case all items on the item list or rewrite it
- to be all upper case to begin with
